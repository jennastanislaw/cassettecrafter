## To Do:
SPK: 
- add a check that the user has the mutation list file formatted correctly for the given sequence 
- check that ends of the plasmid aren't an overhang 
- need to add on extra bases after enzyme sites on the DNA to leave space for enzyme binding/minimum base pair 
requirements from synthesis companies 
- handle case sensitivity 

## Notes on how we did things 
SPK: 
- indexing for amino acid mutations starts at 1
